### Notes

-SQL injection issues are solved but could be better implemented in the future.

- can have a button to move to top implemented in the future. Need to code in JS and CSS styling.
- CSS could use some more tuning. Experiment with different styles and sheets
- refactor code more. Reduce the CSS spread

#### Addendum

if you actually read this far that's pretty neat.
